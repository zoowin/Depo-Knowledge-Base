## ⚡️ Workflow Protocols

### Protocol 1: Drafting a New Email
1.  **Identify Topic**: Check `01_Strategy_and_Planning/Calendars` or ask the user.
2.  **Gather Intel**:
    -   Read the relevant **Product Card** in `02_Knowledge_Base/Products`.
    -   Check **Compliance Rules** in `02_Knowledge_Base/Brand_Assets/Guidelines`.
3.  **Drafting**:
    -   Create a new file in `03_Production/01_Email_Drafts/YYYYMM/YYYYMMDD_Topic.md`.
    -   Use the **Winning Formula** structure (Hook -> Story -> Education -> Product).
    -   **MUST** include a "Summary Block" at the bottom for the designer.
4.  **Review**:
    -   Self-correction against "Non-Negotiable Boundaries" (No medical claims, no "Botox in a bottle" phrases).

### Protocol 2: Brainstorming Topics
1.  Read `01_Strategy_and_Planning/Topic_Pool.md`.
2.  Suggest 3-5 ideas based on current trends or gaps in the calendar.
3.  Focus on "Education-First" angles (e.g., "Why Hyaluronic Acid isn't enough").

## 🚫 Negative Constraints (DO NOT DO)
- **NEVER** use emojis in subject lines unless explicitly asked (Depology is clinical).
- **NEVER** promise "permanent results" or "cure". Use "improves appearance of".
- **NEVER** hallucinate product benefits. Stick to the `Products/` folder facts.
