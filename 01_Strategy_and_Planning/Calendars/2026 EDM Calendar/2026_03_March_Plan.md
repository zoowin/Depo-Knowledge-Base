## 📨 Send Time & Frequency
- **Standard Send Time:** 09:00 AM (Maintain established habit).
- **Promo Send Time:** 15:00 - 17:00 (Test afternoon slump engagement for promos).
- **Frequency:** ~3 emails/week. Focus on quality content to recover domain reputation after high-volume Feb.

---

## 🎯 Segmentation Strategy
- **Post-Archive Sale Buyers:** 
  - Create a "New Customer Welcome" flow (if not automated) or ensure they receive "Routine Building" emails (Mar 2, Mar 20, Mar 29).
  - Exclude recent buyers from heavy promos (Mar 10) to avoid "buyer's remorse" unless it's a complementary product.
- **Engaged (30/60/90):** Core audience for Educational/Trend content.
- **Non-Buyers:** Target heavily with "Social Proof" (Mar 6) and "Women's Day Offer" (Mar 10).

## 🧪 Subject Line Guidance
- **Curiosity:** "Spring cleaning... for your face?" / "Is 'Rice Water' worth the hype?"
- **Empowerment (Women's Day):** "Self-care isn't selfish." / "The Modern Armor."
- **Benefit-Driven:** "Look like you slept 8 hours." / "See the difference 28 days makes."

## 🧠 Operational Notes
- **Creative Direction:**
  - Shift visuals from "Dark/Museum" (Archive Sale) to "Light/Fresh/Botanical" (Spring).
  - Use "Green/White/Soft Pink" color palette.
  - Around Mar 17–20, add subtle "lucky glow" green accents (St. Patrick's).
- **Content Prep:**
  - Need "Rice Water" comparison data/graphics.
  - Need "Spring Routine" infographic (Heavy cream -> Light serum).
- **Offer Strategy:**
  - Mar 10 (Power Duo Week): Bundle Matrixyl + Argireline at ~20% off.
  - Mar 23 (Micro-Dart Launch): 48h intro price with limited stock framing.
  - Mar 26 (Spring Essentials): GWP (e.g., Travel Cleanser) with orders >$80.
