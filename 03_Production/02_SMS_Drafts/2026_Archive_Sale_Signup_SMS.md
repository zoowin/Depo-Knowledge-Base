# SMS Campaign: Archive Sale Vault List Signup 2026

**Campaign:** Archive Sale (The Vault)
**Goal:** Drive signups for Early Access (List Building)
**Target Audience:** Warm / VIP segments
**Tone:** Exclusive, Editorial, Restrained ("Museum Archive")

---

## Strategy
SMS 应保持 Depology 一贯的成熟、克制风格。避免使用过于促销或紧迫的语言（如 "Buy Now!!!", "Huge Sale"），而是强调 "Access"（权限）、"The Vault"（档案室）和 "Discontinued Favorites"（绝版挚爱）。

核心信息：
1.  **The Event:** The Archive Sale / The Vault.
2.  **The Value:** Discontinued favorites, limited sets.
3.  **The Action:** Sign up for Early Access (Priority).
