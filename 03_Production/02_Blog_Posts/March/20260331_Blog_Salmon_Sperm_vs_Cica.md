## Intro

If you've been on TikTok lately, you've probably seen it: influencers raving about "Salmon Sperm Facials."

Yes, you read that right.

The ingredient is technically called **PDRN (Polydeoxyribonucleotide)**, and it’s derived from salmon DNA. It promises to heal skin, boost elasticity, and reverse aging.

But with its rise in popularity, many skincare enthusiasts are asking: *Is it the only way to get these results?*

And for those who prefer plant-based ingredients, is there a vegan alternative that works just as well?

Let's break down the science of PDRN versus the ancient plant healer: **Cica (Tiger Grass)**.

## What is PDRN (Salmon Sperm DNA)?

PDRN is a mixture of DNA fragments extracted from the sperm cells of salmon (usually trout or salmon). Originally used in medicine to help heal wounds and regenerate tissue, it has now crossed over into the skincare world.

### How It Works:
PDRN works by stimulating cell growth and tissue repair. It essentially provides the building blocks (DNA) that help your skin cells regenerate faster.

**The Pros:**
*   Promotes wound healing.
*   Anti-inflammatory properties.
*   Can improve skin elasticity.

**The Cons:**
*   **Animal-Derived:** It is *not* vegan.
*   **The Source:** For those who prefer plant-based or cruelty-free skincare, the animal origin is a key consideration.
*   **Cost:** High-quality PDRN treatments (like Rejuran injections) can be very expensive.

## The Plant Alternative: Cica (Tiger Grass)

While PDRN relies on animal DNA to spur regeneration, **Centella Asiatica (Cica)** has been doing the same job for centuries in traditional medicine.

Legend has it that tigers would roll in this plant to heal their battle wounds—hence the nickname "Tiger Grass."

### The Power Player: Madecassoside
The active compound in Cica, called **Madecassoside**, is a powerhouse for skin repair. It doesn't just soothe; it actively stimulates collagen synthesis and strengthens the skin barrier.

**Why We Choose Cica:**
*   **Proven Repair:** Clinically shown to accelerate wound healing and reduce inflammation.
*   **100% Vegan:** Sourced entirely from plants.
*   **Barrier Support:** It strengthens the skin's natural defenses, making it less reactive over time.

## The Verdict: Which Healer Is Right For You?

If you are comfortable with animal-derived ingredients and are looking for general wound healing, PDRN is a scientifically valid option that many people love.

However, if you want **powerful skin repair and calming benefits** with a **vegan profile**, **Cica is the superior choice.**

(And for those seeking powerful **anti-aging and renewal**, the gold standard is still **Retinol**—backed by 50+ years of science, not just hype.)

It offers the same regenerative benefits—soothing redness, repairing the barrier, and boosting collagen—without compromising on your preference for cruelty-free skincare.

**The Bottom Line:** Both heal. But Cica gives you the results without the fish.
