## 2. Body Section: The "Why"

**Headline:**
Shedding The Winter Coat

**Copy:**
You wouldn’t wear a heavy wool coat in 60°F weather. So why are you still "wearing" your heavy winter skincare?

During winter, our skin is in survival mode—fighting dry air, wind, and indoor heating. We layer on thick, occlusive creams to lock moisture in.

But as the air gets humid and temperatures rise, those heavy layers can start to feel suffocating (and even clog pores).

**Spring Skin Goals:**
*   **Exfoliate:** Gently slough off the dull, dead winter skin cells.
*   **Lighten Up:** Swap heavy creams for hydrating serums.
*   **Protect:** UV rays are getting stronger—don't skip SPF.
