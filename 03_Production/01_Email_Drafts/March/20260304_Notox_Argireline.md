## 2. Body Section: The Shift

**Headline:**
Keep Your Expression, Lose The Lines.

**Copy:**
For years, the only answer to forehead lines and crow's feet was a needle. But the beauty world is shifting.

We’re seeing a move away from the "frozen," immobile look of injectables toward a softer, more natural approach. It's called **"Notox."**

The goal isn't to erase every sign of life from your face. It's to soften the deep-set lines caused by repetitive muscle movement—while still looking like *you*.

**Why make the switch?**
*   🚫 No appointments or downtime.
*   🚫 No "frozen" forehead.
*   ✅ Just softer, smoother, happier skin.
