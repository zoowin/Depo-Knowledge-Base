## 2. Body Section: The Seasonal Shift

**Headline:**
Time to Lighten Up.

**Copy:**
Happy Spring Equinox! As the days get longer and the air gets humid, that rich, heavy moisturizer that saved you in January might start feeling a bit... too much.

Spring is about **transition**. It's time to swap heavy occlusion for lightweight hydration.

**The Golden Rule of Spring Layering:**
Think "Glaze," not "Frosting." Focus on thin, water-based layers that penetrate deep without clogging pores.

## 3. The Spring Swap

**Headline:**
Your New "Lite" Routine.

**1. The Hydration Anchor (Triple Lipid)**
*   **Triple Lipid + Q10 Revive Cream:**
    *   **Why Swap:** A lightweight yet deeply restorative cream that replenishes the barrier without the heaviness of winter balms. Perfect for maintaining moisture balance as temperatures rise.
    *   *Texture:* Rich but absorbs completely.
    *   **[SHOP TRIPLE LIPID]**

**2. The Texture Smoother (Bakuchiol Stick)**
*   **Bakuchiol Smoothing Serum Stick:**
    *   **Why Swap:** Target fine lines and texture on the go without a heavy retinol cream. It’s the plant-based alternative that keeps skin smooth and fresh all day.
    *   *Texture:* Glides on, non-greasy finish.
    *   **[SHOP BAKUCHIOL STICK]**

**3. The Lightweight Seal (Caviar Stick)**
*   **Caviar Multi-Balm Stick:**
    *   **Why Swap:** Skip the heavy night cream during the day. Swipe this only where you need it (dry cheeks, under eyes) for precision moisture that breathes.
    *   *Texture:* Non-sticky, targeted balm.
    *   **[SHOP CAVIAR STICK]**

Simple graphic showing:

**Pro Tip:**
Focus on **"Strategic Moisture."** Use the **Triple Lipid Cream** as your base for barrier health, then use the **Bakuchiol Stick** on areas prone to fine lines (forehead, smile lines) instead of layering heavy actives all over.
