## 2. Body Section: The Myth

**Headline:**
"Is it too late to start?"

**Copy:**
We hear this often: "I should have started sooner." Or conversely, "I'm too young to worry about this."

**The Science of Skin Resilience:**
Collagen production naturally begins to slow down in our mid-20s (dropping about **1% every year**). By our 40s and 50s, hormonal changes can accelerate this process, leading to a loss of firmness.

**But here is the good news:**
Your skin never stops repairing itself. Whether you are preserving what you have in your 30s or restoring bounce in your 50s, the strategy is the same: **Give your skin the right building blocks.**

Don't worry about the past. Focus on supporting your skin's future.
