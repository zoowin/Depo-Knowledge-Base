## 2. What is PDRN?

**Headline:**
Wait... Salmon Sperm?

**Copy:**
Yes, you read that right. The ingredient taking over your feed is **PDRN (Polydeoxyribonucleotide)**, derived from salmon DNA.

**The Claim:** It boosts cell regeneration and repairs damaged skin.
**The Reality:** It works. But... do you prefer vegan skincare?

## 3. The Plant Alternative: Cica
**Headline:**
Animal DNA vs. Plant Power.

**Copy:**
At Depology, we believe in the healing power of **Centella Asiatica (Cica)**.

Legend has it that tigers rolled in this plant to heal their wounds. Today, science confirms that its active compound, **Madecassoside**, stimulates collagen and repairs the skin barrier just as effectively.

**Why we choose Cica:**
✅ 100% Vegan & Cruelty-Free.
✅ Centuries of proven healing.
✅ Soothes redness & inflammation instantly.

## 5. Want Real Renewal? (The Gold Standard)
**Headline:**
Viral Hype vs. Proven Science.

**Copy:**
PDRN claims to reverse aging by stimulating cell turnover. But one ingredient has been the "King of Renewal" for decades: **Retinol**.

Our **Anti-Aging Retinol Night Cream** uses **0.5% Pure Retinol** to speed up cell turnover, smooth texture, and fade fine lines—proven by 50+ years of research, not just TikTok trends.

**Why we choose Retinol:**
✅ The #1 Derm-recommended anti-aging ingredient.
✅ Clinically proven to reduce wrinkles (-5.25% in 28 days).
✅ 100% Vegan & Lab-Formulated.
