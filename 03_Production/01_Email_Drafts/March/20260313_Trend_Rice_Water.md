## 2. Body Section: The Breakdown

**Headline:**
The Internet Loves It. Does Your Skin?

**Copy:**
If you've scrolled TikTok lately, you've seen the "Rice Water" trend. It promises glass skin, brightness, and hydration—all from your kitchen.

**The Reality Check:**
While rice water *does* contain vitamins and amino acids, the molecules are often too large to penetrate deeply. Plus, DIY mixtures can be unstable and inconsistent.

**The Depology Difference:**
We take the *concept* of nourishment and supercharge it with clinical precision.

## 3. The Superior Alternative

**Headline:**
Skip the Prep. Get the Potency.

**1. Instead of Rice Water (For Calming & Hydration)**
*   **Cica Recovery Serum:**
    *   **Why it wins:** Rice water claims to soothe, but **Centella Asiatica (Cica)** is clinically proven to reduce redness and repair the barrier.
    *   *The Result:* Instant relief for sensitive skin, without the fermentation risk.
    *   **[SHOP CICA SERUM]**

**2. Instead of DIY Brightening (For Glass Skin)**
*   **Anti-Aging Retinol Night Cream:**
    *   **Why it wins:** Don't just hydrate the surface. Resurface it. Retinol increases cell turnover to reveal fresh, glowing skin from underneath.
    *   *The Result:* True "Glass Skin" texture that lasts.
    *   **[SHOP RETINOL NIGHT CREAM]**
