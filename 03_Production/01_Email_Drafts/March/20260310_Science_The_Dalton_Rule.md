# Email Campaign: Science: The 500 Dalton Rule

> **Logic Breakdown (逻辑拆解)**
>
> 1.  **Concept (概念)**
>     *   **Theme (主题):** Deep Science / Myth Busting.
>     *   **Hook (钩子):** Why expensive "collagen creams" often fail. (Size matters).
>     *   **Goal (目标):** Educate users on delivery systems (Peptides & Micro-darts) to justify premium pricing and efficacy.
> 2.  **Content Strategy (内容策略)**
>     *   **Educational Angle:** The 500 Dalton Rule (Skin barrier only lets small molecules through).
>     *   **Key Message (核心信息):** Collagen is too big (300,000 Daltons). Peptides are small. Micro-darts are the physical bypass.
> 3.  **Call to Action (CTA) (行动号召)**
>     *   **Action (动作):** Shop the science (High-performance delivery systems).

## 1. Hero Section

**Visual Reference:**
*   **Style:** Scientific, clean, infographic-style.
*   **Image:** A simple diagram showing a large molecule (Collagen) bouncing off the skin surface vs. small molecules (Peptides) penetrating deep.
*   **Headline:** The 500 Dalton Rule
*   **Sub-headline:** Why 90% of skincare ingredients never make it past your barrier.
*   **CTA Button:** LEARN THE SCIENCE

## 2. Body Section: The Science

**Headline:**
Your Skin is Designed to Keep Things Out.

**Copy:**
The "500 Dalton Rule" is a scientific principle that states any molecule larger than **500 Daltons** cannot penetrate the skin barrier effectively.

Here’s the problem:
*   **Collagen:** ~300,000 Daltons (Too big. Sits on top.)
*   **Hyaluronic Acid (Standard):** ~1,000,000 Daltons (Hydrates surface only.)

So, if you're slathering on expensive collagen creams, you might just be moisturizing the very top layer of dead skin cells.

## 3. The Depology Solution

**Headline:**
We Don't Just Apply. We Deliver.

**Copy:**
At Depology, we engineer our formulas to bypass the barrier—either chemically or physically.

**1. The Chemical Bypass (Peptides)**
Instead of trying to force big collagen molecules in, we use **Peptides** (like Matrixyl® 3000).
*   *How it works:* These are tiny chains of amino acids (small enough to penetrate) that signal your skin to produce its *own* collagen from within.
*   **[SHOP MATRIXYL® 3000]**

**2. The Physical Bypass (Micro-darts)**
For ingredients that need to go deeper, we created the **Micro-dart** delivery system.
*   *How it works:* 1000+ crystallized serum darts physically penetrate the outer layer of the skin and dissolve directly into the dermis.
*   *The Result:* Active ingredients are delivered exactly where they are needed most.
*   **[SHOP MICRO-DART PATCHES]**

## 4. Why It Matters

**Copy:**
**Efficacy > Marketing.**

Stop paying for ingredients that sit on the surface. Start investing in delivery systems that get to the root of the problem.

## 5. Summary (Internal Use)

**1. Title/Hook**
"The 500 Dalton Rule" - A strong scientific hook that challenges common skincare myths.

**2. Educational Value**
Explains *why* Depology products work (Peptides & Micro-darts) rather than just saying *that* they work.

**3. Product Focus**
Focuses on the **Technology** (Matrixyl & Micro-darts) rather than a specific "routine" or "bundle". It's about selling the *mechanism of action*.
