## 2. Body Section: The Science

**Headline:**
It’s Not Magic. It’s Cellular Turnover.

**Copy:**
Retinol isn't just a buzzword. It's one of the few ingredients clinically proven to communicate with your cells.

**How it works:**
1.  **Accelerates Turnover:** It speeds up the shedding of dead skin cells.
2.  **Stimulates Production:** It signals your skin to produce more collagen.
3.  **Resurfaces:** The result is smoother texture, faded dark spots, and reduced fine lines.

## 3. The Depology Approach

**Headline:**
Power Without the Pain.

**Copy:**
Many retinols are too harsh, causing redness and peeling. We formulated our **Anti-Aging Night Cream** with **0.5% Pure Retinol**—the "Goldilocks" concentration.

It’s strong enough to deliver visible results, but gentle enough for nightly use (once acclimated).
