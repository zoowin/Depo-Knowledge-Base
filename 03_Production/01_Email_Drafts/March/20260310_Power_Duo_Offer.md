Why They Work Better Together

In honor of Women's Week, we're celebrating powerful partnerships.

**1. The Relaxer (Argireline™)**
*   Targets dynamic wrinkles caused by muscle movement.
*   *Like a "pause button" for expression lines.*

**2. The Builder (Matrixyl® 3000)**
*   Stimulates collagen production to firm and plump the skin.
*   *Like "scaffolding" for your face.*

**The Result:**
Smoother, firmer, more resilient skin.
