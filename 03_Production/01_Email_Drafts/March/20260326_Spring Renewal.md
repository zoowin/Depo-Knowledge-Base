## 2. The Body Hero

Winter layers can leave body skin feeling dry, rough, and bumpy. Before you switch to short sleeves, give your skin a reset.

It’s not just a moisturizer. It’s a treatment.
*   **Retinol & AHA:** Gently exfoliates rough patches and "chicken skin" (KP).
*   **Hydration:** Deeply nourishes without feeling sticky.
*   **The Result:** Silky, touchable skin that glows.

## 3. The Face Reset

**Headline:**
Melt Away The Day.

*   **Melts Everything:** Dissolves waterproof SPF and makeup in seconds.
*   **Hydrates:** Unlike harsh foams, it leaves your barrier soft and intact.
*   **The Texture:** A sherbet-like balm that transforms into a silky oil.

## 5. Summary (Internal Use)

**1. Product Rotation**
Crucial Pivot: Avoids Matrixyl, Argireline, and Cica Serums which were heavily featured in mid-to-late March emails (03/16, 03/25, 03/31). Focuses entirely on **Body Care** and **Cleansing**, which are fresh categories for this period.

**2. Seasonal Logic**
"Skirt Season" is a strong emotional hook for late March/early April. It creates urgency to prep body skin *before* it gets fully warm.

**3. Visual Vibe**
Shifts from "Clinical/Lab" (Peptides) to "Lifestyle/Sunny" (Body/Outdoor preparation).
