**Headline:**
More Than Just Skincare.

**Copy:**
We know that for many of you, your morning and night routines are the only quiet moments in a chaotic day.

It's the 5 minutes where you aren't a mother, a partner, a boss, or a caretaker. You are just **you**.

At Depology, we believe that "anti-aging" isn't about erasing your history. It's about giving your skin the strength and resilience it needs to face the future.

So today, we celebrate the strength, beauty, and resilience of women everywhere.

Take a moment for yourself. You’ve earned it.
