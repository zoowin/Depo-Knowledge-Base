One night step that works while you don’t.

Body Copy (Introduction)
Your skin keeps working long after you turn out the lights. Night is when it leans into repair and renewal — as long as your routine helps, not hurts.

Instead of a long checklist, we focus on one advanced but manageable step: retinol, used thoughtfully, so you can wake up to smoother, more even-looking skin over time.

Section 1 – Why retinol belongs in your night routine
At night, there is no makeup, UV, or daytime stress to compete with. That makes it the ideal window for ingredients that support renewal, like retinol.

To keep things skin-friendly:
* Start low and slow.  
* Increase frequency only when skin feels comfortable.  
* Always pair with SPF in the morning.

Retinol Radiance Rescue Body Lotion  
Line: C. Retinoid Line – Body Renewal

Helps with:
* Rough, uneven-feeling body skin  
* Lack of radiance on arms, legs, or chest  
* Dryness that regular body lotion cannot quite address

How to use:
* Apply at night on clean, dry skin.  
* Massage until absorbed.  
* Use SPF on exposed areas during the day.

Section 4 – Keep the routine simple and sustainable

Sub-heading
Advanced, not overwhelming.

Copy
Retinoid care works best when your routine is repeatable.

Suggested night rhythm:
* Step 1: Gentle cleanse.  
* Step 2: Hydrating or calming serum (optional).  
* Step 3: Retinol Night Cream (1–2 nights per week to start).  
* Step 4: On non-retinol nights, use a barrier-supporting cream if skin feels sensitive.

Non-negotiables:
* Do not stack multiple retinoid products in one routine.  
* Avoid strong acids or harsh exfoliants on retinol nights.  
* Use sunscreen every morning.
