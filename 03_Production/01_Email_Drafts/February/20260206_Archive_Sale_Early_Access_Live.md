**Hero Image**
Visual: An open heavy steel door or a drawer being pulled out, revealing the products inside in a dimly lit, "precious" way.
Text overlay (Minimal): **ACCESS GRANTED** or **THE VAULT IS OPEN**

> **🎨 AI Image Prompts (Midjourney / DALL-E):**
> *   **Option 1 (The Vault Door - Cinematic):** High-end architectural photography of a heavy, brushed steel vault door slightly ajar, warm golden light spilling out from the crack into a dark concrete room. Cinematic lighting, 8k resolution, minimalist, luxury skincare brand aesthetic. No text.
> *   **Option 2 (The Archive Drawer - Editorial):** Angled eye-level shot of an open industrial metal file drawer. Inside, neat rows of minimal white skincare bottles with pharmaceutical-style labels. Soft focus, shallow depth of field, dim ambient lighting with a single beam of light highlighting the products. "Archive" aesthetic, clean, sterile but expensive.
> *   **Option 3 (The Spotlight - Minimalist):** A group of white skincare bottles standing on a dark, textured concrete surface. A single, sharp spotlight hits them from above, creating long dramatic shadows. The rest of the image is in deep shadow. High contrast, mystery, exclusive reveal.

**Visual Direction Notes**
*   **Atmosphere:** Dark mode or very warm, deep beige background. High contrast.
*   **Exclusivity:** Use elements that look like "confidential" stamps or "file numbers" (e.g., "ARCHIVE LOT #2026-A").
*   **Simplicity:** Keep the layout very direct. Headline -> Link -> Products -> Link. Don't over-explain the products; the price and scarcity are the story.
