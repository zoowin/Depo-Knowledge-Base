### **Body Copy: The Mechanism**

**Copy:**
Most topical skincare sits on the surface of your skin (the stratum corneum). While effective, it sometimes struggles to reach the deeper layers where wrinkles form.

**Enter the Micro-Dart Patch.**

Each patch contains over **1,000 self-dissolving micro-cones** formed from crystallized Hyaluronic Acid, Argireline™, and Peptides.

**How it works:**
*Suggestion: Use a 3-step horizontal icon/diagram flow for better readability.*

1.  **Penetrate:**
    *   *Visual:* Cross-section of darts penetrating skin surface.
    *   *Text:* The microscopic cones gently penetrate the outer layer. You might feel a slight "prickle"—that’s a good sign.
2.  **Dissolve:**
    *   *Visual:* Darts dissolving into active ingredients inside the skin.
    *   *Text:* Over 2 hours, the cones dissolve completely, releasing active ingredients directly into the epidermis.
3.  **Target:**
    *   *Visual:* Skin plumping up from within, wrinkle smoothing out.
    *   *Text:* Ingredients work at the source, plumping and smoothing deep lines from within.
