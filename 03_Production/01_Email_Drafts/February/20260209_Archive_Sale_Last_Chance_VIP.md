# Email Campaign: 2026 Archive Sale – VIP Last Chance (Email 7 - VIP Segment)

> **Strategy Note:**
> This version is specifically for the **Early Access / VIP List**. They were given a special code (**SHOP20**) for an extra 20% off.
> This email reminds them that not only is the sale ending, but their *exclusive privilege* is about to expire. The "Double Loss" aversion (Sale ending + Code expiring) is the key driver here.

**Send Date:** Feb 9, 2026 (Monday)
**Segment:** Archive Sale Early Access List (Exclude purchasers)
**Goal:** Squeeze final conversions from VIPs by threatening the loss of their exclusive code.

## Subject Line Options
1. ⚠️ Your code expires at midnight.
2. Don't let your extra 20% OFF slip away.
3. Use code SHOP20 before the Vault locks.
4. Final hours: Extra 20% OFF Archive prices.

**Preview Text**
Last chance to use code SHOP20 for an additional discount. Sale ends tonight.

## Email Content

**Hero Image**
Visual: A digital countdown clock or a "Code Expiring" graphic. High contrast, perhaps showing a ticket or coupon being torn or fading away.
Text overlay: **CODE EXPIRING: SHOP20**

**Headline**
Don't let your code go to waste.

**Subheadline**
The Archive Sale ends tonight. So does your extra 20% OFF.

**Body Copy**
The Vault is locking up at midnight.

As an Early Access member, you secured an exclusive benefit: **an extra 20% OFF** our already reduced Archive prices.

We noticed you haven't used your code yet.

When the clock strikes midnight, two things happen:
1. The Archive Sale closes to the public.
2. Your **SHOP20** code becomes invalid.

This is your final opportunity to stack your exclusive discount on top of Archive pricing.

**Code: SHOP20**

## Visual Direction Notes
- **Differentiation:** This email should look slightly different from the public "Last Chance" email. Use gold or yellow accents to highlight the "VIP Privilege" element.
- **Focus:** The CODE (`SHOP20`) should be the visual hero. Make it large, bold, and impossible to miss.
- **Urgency:** Use a visual countdown timer if possible.

# 设计需求：VIP Last Chance 邮件 (Code Expiring)

**核心差异点:**
*   这封邮件专门发给 **VIP/Early Access** 用户。
*   核心痛点不是“活动结束”，而是“**你的特权代码 (SHOP20) 要作废了**”。

**模块 1: Hero Section**
*   **视觉:** 突出显示 `SHOP20` 这个代码。可以做一个类似“即将过期的优惠券”或者“正在倒计时的数字锁”的视觉效果。
*   **颜色:** 在深色背景中加入一点金色 (Gold) 或亮黄色，代表 VIP 的特权感。

**模块 2: Price Stack (价格叠加演示)**
*   非常直观地展示价格优势：
    *   Strike-through Original Price (e.g., ~$120)
    *   Strike-through Archive Price ($85)
    *   **Highlight VIP Price ($68)** -> 旁边注明 "with code SHOP20"
*   让用户一眼看到不买就是亏了双重折扣。

**模块 3: CTA**
*   按钮文案明确指向使用代码: `USE CODE SHOP20` 或 `CLAIM MY 20% OFF`.
