The beauty of progress.

Subheadline
Let’s celebrate the small wins you’ve already made.

Body Copy
[Option 1: Original - Literary Style]
Progress in skincare rarely looks like an overnight transformation.  
Most of the time, it’s quieter than that—a little calmer skin, a few more nights you remembered your routine, a morning when the mirror felt kinder.

These small moments may not become a dramatic before-and-after, but they are the progress that matters most.

[Option 2: Simple & Encouraging]
Skincare results don't happen overnight. They happen over time.
It’s easy to focus on big changes, but the small steps are just as important. 
Using your serum every morning, sticking to a routine, or simply taking care of your skin—these small habits add up.

You don't need to be perfect every day. You just need to be consistent.

[Option 3: Direct & Benefit-Focused]
Consistency is the key to good skin.
Real results come from daily habits, not one-time miracles.
Every time you apply your skincare, you are investing in your skin’s long-term health.

Focus on the daily routine, and the results will follow.
We are here to help you stay on track.

Brand Perspective Section
At Depology, we design routines to live with you, not against you.  
If all you managed this week was cleansing, a few drops of serum, and moisturizer before bed—that counts.

You don’t need a perfect streak to move forward.  
You just need enough gentle, consistent care over time.

Visual Direction Notes for Design
* Overall Style: 温柔、放松、不急促。更多是「品牌写信给老朋友」的感觉。
* Color Palette: 柔和中性色、淡米色或低饱和暖调，避免强烈对比和过于「campaign」的硬感。
* Typography: 标题可以略大、但轻；正文行距留足空间，营造 breathing room。
* Layout: Hero 图在上，其下是短段落 story＋一个主 CTA。中间的 bullet 区块可以配小图标或极简插画。

Summary (Formula)
1. Title: The Beauty of Progress.
2. Body: 通过「小胜利 / 小进步」的日常画面，安抚读者对不完美执行的焦虑，强调护肤是温和、长期、可以中途停顿再继续的旅程。
3. Product: 品牌层级，不强推单一 SKU，而是轻描淡写带出「舒缓屏障」「长线紧致」「夜间修护」三类方案入口，引导去 routines 而不是一次性大采购。
