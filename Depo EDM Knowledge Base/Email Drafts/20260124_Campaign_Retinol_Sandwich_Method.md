Body Copy
Thinking of pausing Retinol due to winter dryness? Don't stop—**buffer**.

Buffering (often called the "Sandwich Method") is a dermatologist-backed technique to create a controlled release system for your actives.

By placing Retinol between two layers of hydration, you manage its absorption without diluting results. This simple step prevents irritation while keeping your anti-aging routine on track.

**The Perfect Layers:**

**1. The Buffer & Seal:** *Matriplex™ Peptide Intense Cream*
Primes the skin to prevent irritation and locks in moisture.

**2. The Active:** *Anti-Aging Retinol Night Cream*
Sandwiched in the center to renew texture, safe from harsh dry air.

**The Result:**
All the anti-aging benefits. None of the winter redness.
