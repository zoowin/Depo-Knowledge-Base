### **Body Copy: The Problem & Solution**

**Copy:**
We spend time and money perfecting our facial routine, but often ignore the skin from the neck down.

Yet, your body shows signs of aging just like your face:
*   Loss of elasticity (crepey skin)
*   Uneven tone
*   Rough texture

**The Solution: Retinol Radiance Rescue Body Lotion.**

We took our gold-standard **Retinol** and formulated it for the body. It’s not just a moisturizer; it’s an anti-aging treatment for your limbs.

**Benefits:**
*   Smoothes rough elbows and knees.
*   Firms the appearance of skin.
*   Evens out skin tone.
