### **Body Copy: The Problem & Solution**

**Copy:**
We spend time and money perfecting our facial routine, but often ignore the skin from the neck down.

Yet, your body shows signs of aging just like your face:
*   Loss of elasticity (crepey skin)
*   Uneven tone
*   Rough texture

**The Solution: A Full-Body Anti-Aging Protocol.**
 
 We took our gold-standard facial ingredients and created a routine for everything below the chin.
 
 **Step 1: The Daily Resurfacer (Full Body)**
 **Retinol Radiance Rescue Body Lotion**
 Formulated with pure Retinol to smooth rough texture, firm skin, and tackle body breakouts. It’s not just a moisturizer; it’s a treatment.
 *   **Best for:** Arms, legs, and back.
 **[SHOP BODY LOTION]**
 
 **Step 2: The Neck & Chest Specialist**
 **Pro-Firming Overnight Dream Mask**
 The skin on your décolletage is as delicate as your eyelids. Extend this firming mask down to your chest to prevent "tech neck" lines and sleep creases.
 *   **Best for:** Neck and décolletage.
 **[SHOP DREAM MASK]**
 
 **Step 3: The "Body Cocktail" Booster**
 **Matrixyl® 3000 Collagen Serum**
 Want spa-level results? Mix 2-3 pumps of this peptide serum into your body lotion before applying. It boosts collagen support for areas that need extra firming (like knees and elbows).
 *   **Best for:** Mixing with body lotion.
