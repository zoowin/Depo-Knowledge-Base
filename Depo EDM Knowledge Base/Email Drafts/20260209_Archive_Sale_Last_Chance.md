# Email Campaign: 2026 Archive Sale – Last Chance (Email 7)

> **Strategy Note:**
> This is the final push. The goal is pure urgency. The "Vault" concept comes to a close—the doors are shutting. 
> **Correction:** While the Archive Sale event is ending, the key driver is that specific inventory (discontinued items) will likely sell out and not return.

**Send Date:** Feb 9, 2026 (Monday)
**Segment:** Full List (Exclude Archive purchasers)
**Goal:** Last-minute revenue capture / Urgency.

## Email Content

**Hero Image**
Visual: The Vault door is half-closed or in the process of closing. Lighting is dimmer, more dramatic/evening mood. Maybe a "closing soon" sign or just the visual implication of time running out.
Text overlay: **LAST CHANCE // ENDS TONIGHT**

**Headline**
The Vault locks at midnight.

**Subheadline**
Final hours to shop discontinued favorites and exclusive bundles.

**Body Copy**
This is the final call.

At midnight tonight, the Depology Archive will close its doors.

Once the Vault is locked, these discontinued favorites and final-batch bundles will likely disappear for good.

We are down to the last remaining units for several key items. If your cart is still waiting, now is the time to check out.

No code needed. Final pricing is marked.

## Visual Direction Notes
- **Tone:** Urgent, dramatic, "End of an Era" feel.
- **Color Palette:** Darker greys, shadows, perhaps a touch of "warning" color (like a deep rust or muted red) but still keeping the "Archive" elegance. Not a bright red alarm.
- **Lighting:** Spotlight effects on the products, surrounding areas in shadow.
- **Layout:** Keep it short. Hero -> Text -> Products -> Button. The user should be able to scan and click quickly.

# 设计需求：Archive Sale Last Chance 邮件 (2026-02-09)

**整体风格与调性 (Overall Mood):**
*   **核心概念:** "The Vault Closing" (保险库即将关闭 / 闭馆倒计时)。
*   **视觉氛围:** Urgent (紧迫)、Dramatic (戏剧性)、Shadowy (光影对比强)。
*   **色调:** 深灰色 (Dark Greys)、阴影 (Shadows)，可以加入一点点深红色 (Deep Rust/Muted Red) 作为强调色，暗示“最后机会”，但不要破坏整体的高级感。

**模块 1: Hero Section (首屏)**
*   **画面描述:**
    *   展示保险库大门正在关闭的状态，或者光线变暗，只有一道光打在门缝或产品上。
    *   营造一种“夜幕降临，即将闭馆”的氛围。
*   **文字排版:**
    *   **Headline:** `The Vault locks at midnight.` (醒目，紧迫)
    *   **Overlay:** `LAST CHANCE // ENDS TONIGHT`
    *   **字体:** 保持与之前一致的 Serif 字体，但可以加粗或加大。

**模块 2: Product Block (产品展示区)**
*   **状态标签 (Status Tags):** 这一点非常关键。
    *   Matrixyl Bundle: 标记 `Status: Low Stock`
    *   Argireline Bundle: 标记 `Status: Selling Fast`
    *   Retinol Night Cream: 标记 `Status: Final Units`
*   **布局:** 保持清晰，但可以紧凑一些，让用户感觉到东西在减少。

**模块 3: Call to Action (底部)**
*   **按钮:** `SHOP BEFORE MIDNIGHT` (深色背景，浅色文字，高对比度)。
*   **辅助信息:** 再次强调 `Ends at 11:59 PM PST`。
