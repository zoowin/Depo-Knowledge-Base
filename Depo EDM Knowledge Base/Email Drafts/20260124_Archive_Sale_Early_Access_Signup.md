> Logic Breakdown
>
> 1. Title
>    * Concept: The Vault / Archive opening once a year.

> 2. Body
>    * Metaphor: Unlocking a private archive or vault.
>    * Pain Point: Fear of missing out on limited formulas and final runs.
>    * Solution: Join the early-access list to secure first look and priority shopping.
> 3. Offer Positioning
>    * Focus on exclusivity, curation, and last-chance access to selected items.

Email Content

Hero Image
Visual: Editorial, museum-like still life. A warm grey or soft beige background. One or two Depology products are placed on a stone or metal plinth, lit by a narrow beam of light, as if a vault door has just opened. The rest of the frame is in soft shadow to create a quiet, rarefied atmosphere.

Headline
The Vault opens in February.
Get on the list.

Body Copy
Every year, we briefly open the Depology Archive.

Inside, you will not just find another sale. You will find discontinued favorites, limited-edition sets, and final quantities of some of our most requested formulas.

This is a curated event to clear space for what is coming next in 2026, and access is offered to our email community first.

Sign up now to:
– Receive your private access link when the Archive opens in February
– Shop the collection before the general public
– Secure your picks before select items quietly disappear from our shelves

Visual Direction Notes for Design
* Overall Style: Clean and clinical, but warmer and more editorial than a hard sale. Think museum archive or private gallery rather than discount banner.
* Color Palette: Warm grey, soft beige, muted metallic accents. Avoid loud red or bright promotional colors.
* Typography: Refined serif or thin sans serif for headers. Keep copy blocks short with plenty of breathing room.
* Layout: Hero image on top, with the headline and short subheadline either below the image or aligned to one side with generous white space. The CTA button should be clear and centered, with minimal competing elements.
* Archive Motif: Consider subtle archive elements like a thin frame, a label strip, or a faint reference to a drawer or file tab to support the "Archive" story without overcomplicating the design.
