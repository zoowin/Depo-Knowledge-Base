## 3. Product Section (Science Deep Dive)
**Visual Reference:** Product bottle (Argireline™ Peptide Solution 10%) with scientific diagram overlay (optional) or clear texture shot.
**Headline:** How It Works (Without The Ouch)
**Copy:**
Often called "Botox in a jar," **Argireline™ (Acetyl Hexapeptide-8)** targets the same mechanism as injectables but in a non-invasive way.

It works by destabilizing the complex responsible for muscle contractions, helping to relax facial tension. This visibly reduces the depth of dynamic wrinkles—like forehead lines and crow's feet—without a single needle.

**Key Benefits:**
*   Targets dynamic wrinkles & fine lines
*   Non-invasive alternative to injectables
*   Lightweight, water-based formula
