**Hero Image**
Visual: A "contact sheet" or "evidence board" style layout. 3-4 polaroid-style photos pinned to a board. One shows the Retinal Serum, one shows a Discontinued Bundle, one is blurred out. It looks like a backstage planning document.

**Headline**
The catalog is complete.
Here is what we found.

**Body Copy**
We have finished organizing the 2026 Archive Collection.

Next week, the Vault doors will open, giving you access to final quantities of discontinued favorites and rare "imperfect" stock.

We can now confirm that the Archive will include:

**(Product Block 1 - The Hero)**
**The Retinal 0.1% Serum**
*Status: Discontinued Packaging*
The original formula you loved, in our previous glass dropper bottles.
**Archive Price: $10** (Originally $38)

**(Product Block 2 - The Bundle)**
**The Peptide Complex Set**
*Status: Final Run*
We found 150 remaining sets in the warehouse. Once these are gone, this configuration will never exist again.
**Archive Price: 40% OFF**

**(Product Block 3 - The Mystery)**
**Mystery "Imperfect" Boxes**
*Status: Dented Exterior, Perfect Interior*
Full-size luxury skincare where the only flaw is a scratch on the carton.
**Archive Price: From $15**

**Closing & Call to Action**
Quantities are strictly limited. For example, we only have 400 units of the Retinal Serum available.

The only way to secure these before the public launch is to join the Early Access list.

**Visual Direction Notes**
*   **Product Shots:** Raw, unpolished, "behind the scenes" aesthetic. Avoid perfect studio white-background shots. Use flash photography or "warehouse" lighting to sell the "Archive" feel.
*   **Typography:** Use a monospace font (like Courier or similar) for the "Status" and "Price" lines to make it look like a manifest or inventory list.
