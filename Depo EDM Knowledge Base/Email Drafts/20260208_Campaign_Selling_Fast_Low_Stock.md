Since we opened the doors, our most coveted Archive pieces have been moving at record speed.

### **Option 2: The "Empty Space" (Minimalist & Stark)**
> **Concept:** Focusing on the empty space where products used to be, emphasizing what's missing.
> **Prompt:** `Minimalist composition of a modern shelving unit, mostly empty with only a few scattered skincare bottles left, soft ambient lighting, shadows casting on empty spaces, feeling of scarcity, elegant grey and blue tones, architectural style, 8k --ar 9:16`

> **Concept:** Abstract representation of time/stock running out.
