**Myth #1: "Scrubbing harder makes your skin cleaner."**
*   **The Truth:** Aggressive scrubbing strips your natural oils and damages your skin barrier, leading to irritation and more breakouts.
*   **The Solution:** **Opuntia‑C Relief Cleansing Balm**
    *   *Why it works:* A gentle balm cleanser that melts away impurities without scrubbing. It cleanses deeply while keeping your barrier intact.
    *   *Visual:* Balm texture melting on skin vs. harsh scrubbing comparison.
    *   **CTA:** SHOP GENTLE CLEANSING

**Myth #2: "Oily skin doesn't need hydration."**
*   **The Truth:** Dehydrated skin actually produces *more* oil to compensate. Every skin type needs water.
*   **The Solution:** **Matrixyl® 3000 Serum**
    *   *Why it works:* Pure, lightweight hydration that doesn't clog pores. Restores balance to stop excess oil production.

**Myth #3: "Anti-aging is only for when you have wrinkles."**
*   **The Truth:** Prevention is easier than correction. Starting in your mid-20s preserves your collagen bank.

    *   *Why it works:* A gentle introduction to retinoids. Speeds up cell turnover to prevent fine lines before they set in.
