## 💡 Strategy Notes

### 1. The "Double Peak" Revenue Strategy
February 2025 showed massive success with two distinct sale periods:
*   **Early Feb (Archive Sale):** Captures early month spending and V-Day gifting intent.
*   **Late Feb (Warehouse Clearance):** Captures end-of-month paychecks and clears winter inventory.
*   *Action:* We are replicating this structure. Ensure stock levels support two heavy pushes.

### 2. Trend Integration
We are replacing generic educational emails with "Trending" topics found in our Topic Pool:
*   **Skin Cycling:** Replaces generic "routine" emails.
*   **Copper Peptides:** A strong science-backed topic to replace generic ingredient emails.
*   **K-Beauty Comparison:** Leverages the high search volume for K-Beauty to position Depology as a superior or complementary alternative.

### 3. Subject Line Optimization
*   2025's winner was **"Archive Sale is OPEN | Access $10 Retinal Serum!"** (Direct, benefit-driven).
*   We will keep the **"V-day glow-up?"** angle as it had a 56% Open Rate.
*   We will test **"The truth about..."** for the Skin Cycling email to drive curiosity opens.
