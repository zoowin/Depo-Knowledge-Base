# 2026 Archive Sale (The Vault) Campaign Strategy

## 1. Campaign Overview
*   **Theme:** "The Vault Opens" / Archive Sale
*   **Concept:** Once a year, we open our private archive. This is not a "clearance bin" sale; it is a rare opportunity to access discontinued favorites, final batches, and limited runs.
*   **Primary Goal:** Revenue (clearing older inventory) + List Building (Early Access signups).
*   **Tone:** Exclusive, editorial, urgent but sophisticated. "Museum Archive" aesthetic.

## 2. Event Timeline
*   **Signup Phase (Hype):** Jan 24 – Feb 4
*   **Early Access (VIP/List):** Feb 5 (Thursday) @ 9:00 AM
*   **Public Launch:** Feb 6 (Friday) @ 9:00 AM
*   **Close:** Feb 8 (Sunday) @ Midnight

## 3. Email Schedule (7 Emails)

### Phase 1: The Build-Up (Signups)
*   **Email 1: The Teaser**
    *   **Date:** Jan 24 (Sat)
    *   **Angle:** "The Vault opens in February." (Mystery, Concept)
    *   **Goal:** Seed the event, drive initial signups.
    *   **Status:** Drafted.
*   **Email 2: The Sneak Peek (The Reveal)**
    *   **Date:** Jan 30 (Fri)
    *   **Angle:** "Look what we found." (Product Focus)
    *   **Content:** Reveal 2-3 specific "Grail" items returning (e.g., $10 Retinal, Discontinued Serum).
    *   **Goal:** Increase signup conversion by showing value.
    *   **Status:** *To be drafted.*
*   **Email 3: The Countdown**
    *   **Date:** Feb 3 (Tue)
    *   **Angle:** "48 Hours until Early Access." (Urgency)

### Phase 2: The Event (Revenue)
*   **Email 4: Early Access LIVE**
    *   **Date:** Feb 5 (Thu)

*   **Email 5: Public Launch**
    *   **Date:** Feb 6 (Fri)
    *   **Audience:** Full List (Include purchasers)

    *   **Date:** Feb 7 (Sat)

    *   **Angle:** "The Vault locks at midnight."
    *   **Content:** Last chance for 12 months.

## 4. Offer & Product Strategy

### Discount Logic
Instead of a flat % off, use **Tiered "Archive" Pricing** to build baskets:
*   **"The $10 Vault"**: Entry-level impulse buys (Sheet masks, near-expiry serums).
*   **"The $25 Collection"**: Core serums with old packaging.
*   **"The 50% Off Sets"**: Bundles of discontinued lines.

### Key Products (Based on Inventory)
1.  **Retinal Serum ($10 Hero):** The main hook. High perceived value, deep discount.
2.  **Discontinued Sets:** "Last chance to own."
3.  **Imperfect Box Stock:** "Perfect product, imperfect box."

### Rules
*   **Final Sale:** No returns/exchanges (standard for Archive sales).
*   **Limits:** Max 3 per customer (creates scarcity).
